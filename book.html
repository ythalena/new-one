            It‚Äôs incredible to think how just a few days ago, I didn‚Äôt even know
            who you were. Meeting you through [platform] was a chance I‚Äôm
            forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would
            connect, how we‚Äôd talk, or how you‚Äôd be. But now, after just a short
            time of talking, I‚Äôve come to realize something‚Äîyou're absolutely
            amazing

            I sometimes wish I could meet you in person, but I know it might be
            a long shot. Still, I hope that, even though we've only known each
